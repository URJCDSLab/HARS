# HARS
This repository contains the python code of the HARS methodology from paper "Selecting sampling ratios in imbalanced dataset through class complexity" to select the sampling ratio of a preprocessing sampling method applied to imbalanced data and some results of the experiments.

* Datasets collects the real benchmark datasets used for the experiments.
* Algorithm_code contains the code of HARS and the code of the Hostility measure used to calculate the complexity in HARS.
* Experiments contains more detailed and disagreggated results than those summarized in the paper.
